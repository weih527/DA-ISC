## Introduction

This repository is the **official implementation** of the [paper](https://conferences.miccai.org/2022/en/), "Domain Adaptive Mitochondria Segmentation via Enforcing Inter-Section Consistency", where more implementation details are presented.

## Installation

This code was tested with Pytorch 1.0.1 (later versions may work), CUDA 9.0, Python 3.7.4 and Ubuntu 16.04. It is worth mentioning that, besides some commonly used image processing packages, you also need to install some special post-processing packages for neuron segmentation, such as [waterz](https://github.com/funkey/waterz) and [elf](https://github.com/constantinpape/elf).

If you have a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment, we strongly recommend you to pull our image as follows,
